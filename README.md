# Badged Drawer Arrows

An example of the androidx [`DrawerArrowDrawable`][DrawerArrowDrawable] class
extended to add a badge with various features.

</p>

A Compose version is also included. It simply wraps the custom drawable in an
`IconButton`. I'd imagine there's already some other solution for Compose, but I
was curious and it was easy enough to put together.

The project has been set up as libraries and configured to be published, so you
can get compiled dependencies through the very handy service [JitPack][JitPack],
if the existing implementation happens to suit your needs.

## Added features

`DrawerArrowDrawable` still works the same underneath, and all of its properties
and functions are still available as noted in its documentation.

This table briefly summarizes the new features added to
[`BadgedDrawerArrowDrawable`][BadgedDrawerArrowDrawable], and therefore also to
Compose's [`BadgedDrawerArrow`][BadgedDrawerArrow].

| Property              | Type               | Description                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `isBadgeEnabled`      | `Boolean`          | Whether a badge is drawn.                   |
| `badgeSize`           | `BadgeSize`        | Options for the badge's size.               |
| `badgeColor`          | `Int`/`Color`      | Color of the badge's background.            |
| `badgeCorner`         | `Corner`           | Corner of hamburger to center the badge on. |
| `badgeOffset`         | `PointF`/`Offset`  | For minor adjustments to badge placement.   |
| `badgeClipMargin`     | `Float`            | Margin clipped out of the base drawable.    |
| `badgeText`           | `String`           | (Optional) text to be drawn on the badge.   |
| `badgeTextSize`       | `(Float) -> Float` | Allows adjustments to the default size.     |
| `badgeTextColor`      | `Int`/`Color`      | Color of the badge's text, if any.          |
| `badgeTextOffset`     | `PointF`/`Offset`  | For minor adjustments to text placement.    |
| `badgeMotion`         | `Motion`           | (Optional) animation to apply to the badge. |
| `autoMirrorOnReverse` | `Boolean`          | Whether to mimic `ActionBarDrawerToggle`.   |

`ActionBarDrawerToggle` calls [`setVerticalMirror(Boolean)`][setVerticalMirror]
on its `DrawerArrowDrawable` at positions `0F` and `1F` with alternating values,
causing it to rotate in the same direction when the drawer closes as when it
opens. That's what the `autoMirrorOnReverse` property does: tells the drawable
to handle this automatically without being attached to an
`ActionBarDrawerToggle`.

<br />

## Usage

### Views

Like the base class, [`BadgedDrawerArrowDrawable`][BadgedDrawerArrowDrawable]
can be used on its own wherever you can stick a `Drawable`. You'll have to
handle animating the position value yourself, though, but other than that, it's
just a regular ol' drawable, really. The app in the `demo` module does it with a
`ValueAnimator`, so you can look there for an explicit demonstration.

There are a couple of slightly different ways to hook it up to
`ActionBarDrawerToggle`, and the following snippets show the minimum
requirements for each, code-wise.

#### Using the support `ActionBar`

<details>
    <summary><tt>ActionBarActivity</tt></summary>

```kotlin
class ActionBarActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    private lateinit var toggle: ActionBarDrawerToggle

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

        val ui = ActivityActionBarBinding.inflate(layoutInflater)
        setContentView(ui.root)

        supportActionBar?.setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled(true)

        toggle = ActionBarDrawerToggle(
            this,
            ui.drawerLayout,
            R.string.opened,
            R.string.closed
        )

        val context = supportActionBar?.themedContext ?: this
        toggle.drawerArrowDrawable =
            BadgedDrawerArrowDrawable(context).apply {
                isBadgeEnabled = true
                badgeText = "99+"
            }

        ui.drawerLayout.addDrawerListener(toggle)
    }

    override fun onPostResume() {
        super.onPostResume()
        toggle.syncState()
    }

    override fun onOptionsItemSelected(item: MenuItem): Boolean {
        if (toggle.onOptionsItemSelected(item)) return true
        return super.onOptionsItemSelected(item)
    }
}
```

</details>

That snippet assumes that your theme is supplying the `ActionBar`; i.e., it's
not a `NoActionBar` theme. If you're supplying your own `Toolbar` for the
`ActionBar`, then it's the same as above, just with a call to
`setSupportAction()` right after `setContentView()`.

If you're not using an `ActionBar` specifically, it can work with `Toolbar`
separately.

#### Using a `Toolbar` directly

<details>
    <summary><tt>ToolbarActivity</tt></summary>

```kotlin
class ToolbarActivity : AppCompatActivity() {

    private lateinit var toggle: ActionBarDrawerToggle

    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)

        val ui = ActivityToolbarBinding.inflate(layoutInflater)
        setContentView(ui.root)

        toggle = ActionBarDrawerToggle(
            this,
            ui.drawerLayout,
            ui.toolbar,
            R.string.opened,
            R.string.closed
        )

        toggle.drawerArrowDrawable =
            BadgedDrawerArrowDrawable(ui.toolbar.context).apply {
                isBadgeEnabled = true
                badgeText = "99+"
            }

        ui.drawerLayout.addDrawerListener(toggle)
    }

    override fun onPostResume() {
        super.onPostResume()
        toggle.syncState()
    }
}
```

</details>

<br />

### Compose

In many ways, [`BadgedDrawerArrow`][BadgedDrawerArrow] is easier to employ, and
like the `Drawable`, it can be used on its own, should you need it for something
other than a drawer. For example, if you just need a hamburger icon to sit there
and look pretty:

```kotlin
BadgedDrawerArrow(0F)
```

Or the arrow instead:

```kotlin
BadgedDrawerArrow(1F)
```

The bars' default color here is `LocalContentColor`, Compose's nifty mechanism
that helps to ensure an appropriate color to contrast with the background, so
you don't even have to worry about that for basic usage.

`BadgedDrawerArrow` also works well with Compose's animations, like
`animateFloatAsState()`, though it's obviously geared toward use with a drawer.
To that end, there's an overload that takes an instance of a helper class,
`DrawerToggle`, that exposes and manages a `DrawerState` and its relative
progress. That overload also sets `autoMirrorOnReverse` to `true` by default,
and automatically toggles the drawer upon clicking, which makes for a quick and
easy drawer setup.

#### Automatic toggle setup

<details>
    <summary><tt>AutomaticToggleExample()</tt></summary>

```kotlin
private val DrawerWidth = 240.dp

@Preview(showBackground = true)
@Composable
fun AutomaticToggleExample() {
    val drawerToggle = rememberDrawerToggle(DrawerWidth)
    Column {
        BadgedDrawerArrow(drawerToggle)
        ModalNavigationDrawer(
            drawerState = drawerToggle.drawerState,
            drawerContent = {
                Box(
                    Modifier
                        .width(DrawerWidth)
                        .fillMaxHeight()
                        .background(Color.Blue)
                )
            }
        ) {}
    }
}
```

</details>

This version doesn't offer an `onClick` parameter, however, so if you need to
perform additional work for clicks, you'll have to set up the toggle manually.

#### Manual toggle setup

<details>
    <summary><tt>ManualToggleExample()</tt></summary>

```kotlin
private val DrawerWidth = 240.dp

@Preview(showBackground = true)
@Composable
fun ManualToggleExample() {
    val drawerToggle = rememberDrawerToggle(DrawerWidth)
    Column {
        BadgedDrawerArrow(
            autoMirrorOnReverse = true,
            progress = drawerToggle.progress(),
            onClick = { drawerToggle.toggle(); /* Other thingsâ€¦ */ }
        )
        ModalNavigationDrawer(
            drawerState = drawerToggle.drawerState,
            drawerContent = {
                Box(
                    Modifier
                        .width(DrawerWidth)
                        .fillMaxHeight()
                        .background(Color.Blue)
                )
            }
        ) {}
    }
}
```

</details>

If you wanna skip the `DrawerToggle` altogether, for whatever reason, it's only
a few more lines to provide the parts yourself.

#### Manual drawer setup

<details>
    <summary><tt>ManualDrawerExample()</tt></summary>

```kotlin
private val DrawerWidth = 240.dp

@Preview(showBackground = true)
@Composable
fun ManualDrawerExample() {
    val scope = rememberCoroutineScope()
    val drawerState = rememberDrawerState(DrawerValue.Closed)
    Column {
        BadgedDrawerArrow(
            autoMirrorOnReverse = true,
            progress = drawerState.progress(DrawerWidth),
            onClick = { scope.launch { drawerState.toggle() } }
        )
        ModalNavigationDrawer(
            drawerState = drawerState,
            drawerContent = {
                Box(
                    Modifier
                        .width(DrawerWidth)
                        .fillMaxHeight()
                        .background(Color.Blue)
                )
            }
        ) {}
    }
}
```

</details>

The `DrawerState.progress()` and `DrawerState.toggle()` extensions are public in
the Composables' file.

## Notes

- Currently, the main caveat is that there are basically no restrictions or
  checks or coercions on input. For example, the badge is designed to show
  numbers of length 1..3 relatively comfortably, but it does not prevent you
  from entering values outside of those bounds, and neither does it do anything
  to "correct" an out-of-bounds value before application. Checks may be added in
  the future, but for now, it's up to the user to ensure workable input for the
  desired results.

- The text layout is geared toward number glyphs. That is, the default text
  sizes were calculated to work well with any number of length 1..3, but a
  string of "MMM", for example, would end up being wider than the badge. If
  needed, the `badgeTextSize` property and parameter are
  `(default: Float) -> Float` functions to allow adjustments.

- Letters and numbers are not regular shapes, obviously, which makes it
  difficult to center them visually, especially in arbitrary combinations.
  Therefore, the current algorithm simply centers them according to their
  enclosing bounds, which is technically correct, but prone to causing some
  strings to look very wrong. The `badgeTextOffset` property/parameter is
  available to fiddle with the text placement, if needed.

- The default values for the hamburger-arrow dimensions â€“ e.g., `barThickness`,
  `arrowHeadLength`, etc. â€“ come from styles in appcompat themes, and they're
  all pretty consistent across configurations, except for `barLength` and 
  `gapBetweenBars`, which differ as follows:

  | Attribute        |  values  |  values-hdpi  |
  |------------------|---------:|--------------:|
  | `barLength`      | `18dp`   | `18.66dp`     |
  | `gapBetweenBars` | `3dp`    | `3.33dp`      |

  I have no idea why those are the only ones that change, nor why it's only by
  a handful of pixels at most, but I decided to ignore this, and the defaults in
  both frameworks are always the integer `values`, regardless of the current
  configuration.

- For now, this project is considered to be examples more than a proper library.
  Consequently, there are several lint warnings across the project about unused
  elements, some things that should be hidden might be visible, and things may
  break without prior warning or deprecation. 

- There are no code docs, unfortunately. I may add some eventually, but most
  things should be rather self-explanatory.

- The `demo` module contains a simple app that demonstrates most of the
  available features, in both frameworks.
